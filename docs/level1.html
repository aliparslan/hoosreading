        <h3>Memories of my first day at school</h3>
        <p>I remember my first day at school very well. I knew the school quite well because my older sister, Sandy, went there and every day, dad and I met her at the school gate after school. Every day, she ran out of the school with her friends. She often carried a painting. I felt jealous. I wanted to paint too!</p>
